# Improvements

The current list of improvements, in order of priority. Stage 5 of the [roadmap](../README.md#roadmap) is on hold while this list is being worked on.

## 1. Administration page

**Status:** done.

A page for administrators at `/admin`, with the image processing settings. They are stored in the database and read for each photo, so a change applies to the next photo processed.

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---|---:|---|
| Preview format | WebP | WebP, JPEG |
| WebP quality | 75 | 1–100 |
| WebP compression effort | 2 | 0–6 |
| JPEG quality | 80 | 1–100 |
| Grid preview size | 400 px | 200–800 |
| Viewer preview size | 2048 px | 1024–4096 |

Purely technical settings stay in the environment, such as the number of workers. Stripping metadata, auto-rotation and sRGB conversion are not configurable. Users and folder imports remain separate pages.

Settings apply to new photos only. Regenerating existing previews would be a separate improvement, since it is a background task that takes hours and needs progress and protection from running twice.
