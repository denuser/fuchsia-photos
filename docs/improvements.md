# Improvements

The current list of improvements, in order of priority. Stage 5 of the [roadmap](../README.md#roadmap) is on hold while this list is being worked on.

## 1. Administration page

**Status:** done.

A page for administrators at `/admin`, with the image processing settings. They are stored in the database and read for each photo, so a change applies to the next photo processed.

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---|---:|---|
| Preview format | WebP | WebP, JPEG |
| WebP quality | 75 | 1–100 |
| WebP compression effort | 2 | 0–6 |
| JPEG quality | 80 | 1–100 |
| Grid preview size | 400 px | 200–800 |
| Viewer preview size | 2048 px | 1024–4096 |

Purely technical settings stay in the environment, such as the number of workers. Stripping metadata, auto-rotation and sRGB conversion are not configurable. Users and folder imports remain separate pages.

Settings apply to new photos only. Regenerating existing previews would be a separate improvement, since it is a background task that takes hours and needs progress and protection from running twice.

## 2. Timeline for large libraries

**Status:** done.

The timeline loads month by month from counts the server gives first, with month titles and a scrubber with the years. A month near the screen loads all of its pages; months far from it are only counted. The trash keeps loading page by page, with a spinner at the end of the list and a retry button when a page fails. Decisions are in the [README](../README.md#decisions).

Loaded months stay in memory. Unloading the months far from the screen is left for when a library makes it necessary.

## 3. Camera and lens filters

**Status:** done.

The timeline filters by camera and by lens, next to the tags and dates. On a phone they sit behind one button with the dates. The counts in each list take the other filters into account. Decisions are in the [README](../README.md#decisions).

The lists offer only the user's own photos, and other pages, such as albums and "Shared with me", have no such filters yet.
